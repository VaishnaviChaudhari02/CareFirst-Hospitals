</div>
<div>
	<p>CareFirst Group ventured into healthcare services under the capable leadership of Dr. Chandramma D Sagar in the 60s with the establishment of Chandra Nursing Home. Almost four decades later, her legacy and vision was carried forward by her two sons, Dr. D Hemachandra Sagar and Dr. D Premachandra Sagar. They set on the path of providing affordable yet world-class healthcare to their immediate community by founding one of the first corporate, 250 bedded, multi-speciality tertiary care hospital in the city of Bengaluru in the year 2002. This was followed by an ambitious 415 bedded, multi-speciality tertiary care hospital in the year 2009. CareFirst Hospitals is synonymous with quality healthcare, efficiency, reliability and has set very high standards in the healthcare sector in the State.
